# Project: Stock Portfolio Tracker App

## Pesudocode

### State Management

```javascript
const [watchlist, setWatchlist] = useState([]); 
const [savedStocks, setSavedStocks] = useState([]); 
const [realWatchlist, setRealWatchlist] = useState({});
const [ticker, setTicker] = useState("");
const [stockData, setStockData] = useState(null);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
const [error, setError] = useState(null);
```

### Adding a Stock to the Watchlist

```javascript
const addToWatchlist = (stock) => {
  const isAlreadyInWatchlist = watchlist.some(
    (item) => item.symbol === stock.symbol
  );

  if (isAlreadyInWatchlist) {
    alert("This stock is already in your watchlist.");
    return false;
  } else {
    setWatchlist([...watchlist, stock]);
    return true;
  }
};
```

### Fetching Stock Data

```javascript
const fetchData = async (ticker) => {
  setLoading(true);
  setError(null);

  try {
    const res = await fetch(
      `https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=GLOBAL_QUOTE&symbol=${ticker}&apikey=${STOCK_API_KEY}`
    );

    if (!res.ok) {
      throw new Error("Unable to fetch");
    }

    const data = await res.json();
    console.log(data);

    if (!Object.keys(data["Global Quote"]).length) {
      setError("Ticker can't be found!");
      return;
    } else {
      setStockData(data["Global Quote"]);
    }
  } catch {
    setError("Fetching failed, try again!");
  } finally {
    setLoading(false);
  }
};
```
# Key Learnings
## State mangement
The proper way to manage states should be done in the parent component. In this project I had to duplicate the code for fetching data and storing onto another state. A more appropriate solution is to lift the state via the parent. 

## Naming conventions
There was alot of confusion as I was naming functions and variables and spent alot of time trying to figure out what they are and what they do. 

## Shaping data structures
When fetching data from api and saving them onto local states, there was alot of troubleshooting done as the data received wasn't saving or there was errors. I need to define the shape early in the brainstorming stage and make them consistent across the codes.

# Planning future enhancements 
To include a live streaming video feed 
RSS feeds which updates trending news
Integrate twitter feed from personal account

# Why this app 
As a avid trader, on my workstation I find myself constantly opening multiple tabs programs and having to switch between the screens a hassle. I develop this app in order to have an all-in-one solution and focus on tasks that matters.
